# FundMgr

## Assumptions made
* Amount and inception date CANNOT be null (the example csv has invalid test cases that should be rejected)
* We should actually create 3 models for Fund one Fund Management could have many strategies, likewise (more arguable) multiple strategy types could be used by many funds managements

## TODO
The goal is to generate a simple Django application with simply SQLite as the database, and with
- ~~a single Model called Fund, representing the data in the attached sample_fund_data.csv~~
- ~~a way to import such Fund objects by uploading a CSV file matching the sample provided, via a file upload form on a Django web page: the Django app should then parse that file and create corresponding Fund objects in the database~~
- ~~a web page displaying:~~
  - ~~the list of funds available in the database as a table with one column per field on the Fund model~~
  -	~~a dropdown at the top of the page, allowing you to select a Strategy value, and filter the funds displayed on the page by one of the available Strategy choices~~
  -	~~at the bottom of the table, display the total number of Funds in the database~~
  - ~~if the current page is filtered by a Strategy value, then this number should be the number of Fund objects matching the filter~~
  -	~~at the bottom of the table, display one number that is the sum of all Fund AUM values (AUM is one number field listed in the sample CSV file)~~
- ~~A REST API endpoint that can~~
  -	~~list Fund objects that are in the database, in a JSON format~~
  -	~~a way to filter the objects by the Strategy field, by appending a query parameter ?strategy=[value] to the URL of that endpoint~~
  -	~~another endpoint to view a JSON representation of a single Fund object identified by its id field~~
- As a bonus, write one or more automated tests within the Django app, checking that some of the specs above are working. Tests can be run with the command manage.py test
